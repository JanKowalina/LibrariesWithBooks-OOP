# Libraries with Books

This project implements a Book class and a Library class in C++. The Book class represents a book with an author and a title, while the Library class manages a collection of books.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile the source code files using a compiler such as GCC, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to compile the source files:
   ```shell
   g++ main.cpp book.cpp library.cpp -o program
   ```
   This command compiles all the source files (`main.cpp`, `book.cpp`, `library.cpp`) and links them into an executable file named "program" (you can choose a different name if you like).

2. After successful compilation, you can run the program by executing the generated executable:
     ```shell
     ./program
     ```

## Usage

Run the program, and it will execute the code in the main function. Observe how it works, feel free to edit and test it.
